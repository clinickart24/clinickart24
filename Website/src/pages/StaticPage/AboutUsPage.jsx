                In 2010, our founder, Vasily, faced a daunting challenge -
                preparing for the Law School Admission Test (LSAT) while
                juggling an internship and evening classes in different cities.
                The lack of time and a conducive study environment made it
                incredibly difficult for him to achieve his dream of becoming a
                lawyer.
                <br />
                During a train ride, a moment of inspiration struck Vasily. He
                wished for a convenient study tool on his phone to help him
                prepare for the LSAT. However, such an app didn't exist at the
                time. Determined to overcome this hurdle, Vasily took matters
                into his own hands and developed one of the earliest and most
                comprehensive LSAT apps on the market. The app quickly gained
                popularity, becoming the #1 paid LSAT app for over a year.
