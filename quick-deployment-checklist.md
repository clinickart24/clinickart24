// TO:
value={{ user, login, logout, loading, isAuthenticated: !!user }}
```

### 2. Environment Variables (All 3 Panels)
```bash
# Website/.env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here

# Admin_Panel/.env  
REACT_APP_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
REACT_APP_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here

# Vendor_Panel/.env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here
```

### 3. Domain Structure
```
yourdomain.com           â†’ Main Website (Customers)
admin.yourdomain.com     â†’ Admin Panel (Full Control)
vendor.yourdomain.com    â†’ Vendor Panel (Vendor Management)
```

### 4. Supabase Configuration
- **Authentication**: Email/Password enabled
- **RLS**: Enabled on all tables
- **Storage**: Public bucket for product images
- **Policies**: Role-based access control

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue 1: "Cannot connect to Supabase"
**Solution**: Check environment variables are correctly set and Supabase project is active

### Issue 2: "Authentication not working"
**Solution**: Verify you fixed the hardcoded `isAuthenticated:true` in AuthContext

### Issue 3: "Products not loading"
**Solution**: Check RLS policies allow public access to published products

### Issue 4: "SSL certificate failed"
**Solution**: Ensure DNS records are propagated (wait 24 hours max)

### Issue 5: "Admin panel not accessible"
**Solution**: Check Nginx configuration and subdomain DNS record
